# [USELESS PROJECT] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [ASTRAL PROJECTORS]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Ancy Binu] - [Jyothi Engineering]

### Project Description
[A 1-page ‚Äúe-commerce‚Äù website that sells utterly useless items no sane person would ever need ‚Äî from ‚ÄúAir in a Jar‚Äù to ‚ÄúLeft Shoe Only.‚Äù Perfect for wasting time and imaginary money.]

### The Problem 
[People have too many useful things in their lives. The world is drowning in practicality. No one has a place to spend their imaginary cash on products that serve no purpose whatsoever.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We built an online store dedicated to selling the most absurd, impractical, and nonsensical objects imaginable. Click ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù and get nothing delivered ‚Äî with a smile!]
